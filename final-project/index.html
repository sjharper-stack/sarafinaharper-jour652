                This November, the threat of losing SNAP food assistance benefits during the government shutdown shook
                Maryland residents before the state government stepped in to use state funds to fill the gap.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 2025, SNAP participants make up 11% of Maryland’s population, according to Maryland.gov SNAP data
                (https://priorities.maryland.gov/datasets/snap/explore) in relation to MD Census data
                (https://planning.maryland.gov/Msdc/Pages/default.aspx).
                 <a href="www.google.com">testbug</a>
              </p>
             

              <p>
                While the percentage of Maryland residents who receive SNAP has decreased since the height of the
                COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, available data suggests that this crucial program is necessary but not
                sufficient to alleviate hunger in Maryland.
              </p>

              <p>
                In 2020 an internal briefing delivered to Baltimore City’s elected officials suggested that over 40% of
                Baltimore residents would struggle with food insecurity that summer.
                (https://therealnews.com/mutual-aid-in-public-housing-continues-after-housing-authority-pushback)
              </p>

              <p>
                While Maryland Gov data shows that SNAP enrollment skyrocketed to over 850K individuals that year, this
                number comprises only 14% of Maryland residents would have been enrolled in SNAP at the time.
              </p>

              <p>
                Reporting from 2020 shows how Baltimore residents form community networks to address food scarcity in
                Baltimore City. Current data enables us to see that food scarcity in Baltimore did not end with
                COVID-19, and that SNAP is relied on at similar rates today.

          <p>
            In early April, Baltimore City’s Housing Authority threatened Reverend Annie Chambers with arrest and
            eviction for distributing food to her neighbors at Douglass Homes, citing a policy barring non-government
            organizations from giving food donations to public housing residents.Rather than stopping Chambers’ mutual
            aid initiative, the incident led to widespread support for her work. Chambers says that the Housing
            Authority has not interfered with a giveaway since and that the public attention has resulted in an
            increase in donations.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="washington-blockquote">
            “Maryland State Senator Mary Washington, who expressed support for Chambers, noted that food insecurity in
            Baltimore City increased rapidly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.Senator Washington said she received
            a briefing from Baltimore City’s Office of Sustainability stating that the city agency “anticipate[s] that
            a quarter of a million people [in Baltimore City] are going to be food insecure in a month,” Washington
            told The Real News Network.” According to the most recent census data available, that city briefing
            suggests that more than 40% of Baltimore City residents will suffer from food insecurity by June.
            Washington noted that SNAP benefits are being processed more slowly than usual, worsening Baltimore’s food
            crisis."
          </blockquote>

          <p>”We have not had any trouble from them since. People called The Housing Authority from Washington, New York,
            Philadelphia and Virginia,” Chambers told The Real News Network. “Senator [Mary] Washington and the Teachers
            Union called the Housing Authority. Many single individuals have called the mayor and The Housing Authority
            on our behalf.”</p>

          <p>
            Maryland State Senator Mary Washington, who expressed support for Chambers, noted that food insecurity in
            Baltimore City increased rapidly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
          </p>

          <p>
            Senator Washington said she received a briefing from Baltimore City’s Office of Sustainability stating that
            the city agency “anticipate[s] that a quarter of a million people [in Baltimore City] are going to be food
            insecure in a month,” Washington told The Real News Network.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to the most recent census data available, that city briefing suggests that more than 40% of
            Baltimore City residents will suffer from food insecurity by June. Washington noted that SNAP benefits are
            being processed more slowly than usual, worsening Baltimore’s food crisis.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lawyer Alec Summerfield filed a cease-and-desist letter on behalf of Chambers, arguing that The Housing
            Authority’s threats of eviction violate Maryland’s stay-at-home order as well as the UN Charter on Human
            Rights.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Article 25 [of the UN Charter on Human Rights] states that all people have the right to have access to
            food, particularly in times of crisis and political strife,” Summerfield said. “And given the extent to
            the price gouging and how hard it is for people to get to grocery stores with the food deserts in
            Baltimore, it’s a violation of those rights for the city to deny non-profits the right to give food to
            people.”
          </p>

          <p>
            According to Summerfield, The Housing Authority violated Maryland’s stay-at-home order, which bans all
            evictions until further notice. He says he is in touch with two other Douglass residents who volunteered
            with Chambers and were also threatened with eviction during the stay-at-home order.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Housing Authority told The Real News Network that they attempted to shut down food giveaways at Douglass
            Homes because of a standard policy that prohibits non-government organizations from distributing food to
            public housing residents and not because of COVID-19.
          </p>

          <p>
            Washington said that The Housing Authority has a responsibility to “help bring Ms. Chambers and her
            organization into compliance” with health and safety regulations rather than impede their efforts.
          </p>

          <p>
            “People want to help so instead of setting up bureaucratic obstacles, we should figure out how to help them.
            The CDC, and Baltimore City Health Department have regulations for what the best practices are [during
            COVID-19],” Washington said. “As long as people are abiding by those rules, they should be supported- and
            there should be support and resources to help people follow those rules. Anyone who wants to do that should
            be part of the overall strategy. I felt what happened was a bureaucratic knee-jerk response that was not
            solution-oriented.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Activists and Douglass residents have reason not to trust the Housing Authority—not only because of how they
            threatened Chambers but also because of a 2016 lawsuit that revealed Housing Authority employees had
            demanded sexual favors in exchange for necessary maintenance.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Housing Authority’s attempt to shut down food giveaways at Douglass Homes occurred while Baltimore City
            began directing 211 emergency calls from food-insecure residents to some of the same grassroots
            organizations that donate to public housing.
          </p>

          <p>
            United Way’s new relationships with the grassroots organizations have been necessary to respond to the spike
            in calls for food assistance in light of COVID-19.
          </p>

          <p>“Our call volume has increased over four hundred percent,” Suzanne Poandl of United Way said.</p>

          <p>
            “We have staff who man the calls, most of them have a social work background. We have brought on 70 plus
            volunteers to help with those calls [since the pandemic].”
          </p>

          <p>
            The Greater Baltimore Collaborative, an alliance of 11 nonprofit groups including United Way, awarded grants
            to Baltimore Food Rescue, 4MyCity, and So What Else in April, at the direction of Baltimore City’s Office
            of Sustainability.
          </p>

          <p>
            Molly Rath, Baltimore City’s Director of Communications and Engagement, outlined the city’s response to the
            food crisis in a May 4 email to The Real News Network: “On April 21, Mayor Young announced a comprehensive
            strategy to respond to growing food need during the coronavirus pandemic, and meal distribution sites make
            up a core component of that strategy,” she said.
          </p>

          <p>
            Between March 16-April 16, the city distributed 705,155 meals and 1,840 grocery boxes and they plan to
            increase the number of meals they distribute in May and June. Chambers says the city food sites won’t be
            able to alleviate hunger unless they turn their focus to fresh produce, meat, eggs, and other take-home
            groceries.
          </p>

          <p>
            “When the city truck comes and you’re hungry, and you’ve been hungry, and they hand you a sandwich with one
            piece of baloney between two pieces of bread, that’s like saying ‘go die’ and that’s all the help we’ve been
            given,” Chambers said.
          </p>
