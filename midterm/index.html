<h1>Marylanders Brace for Natural Gas Export Facility</h1>

<h2> By:Lyle Kendrick, Capital News Service </h2>

COVE POINT - The natural gas pipes on Dominion’s Cove Point property begin on a
pier in the Chesapeake Bay.
They then descend underground and run for more than a mile behind the walls of a
dimly-lit tunnel for foot-brake bicycles that workers use to travel from the dock
to shore. Above ground, the pipes pass acres of trees and finally connect to seven
massive storage tanks before the gas ultimately travels to American consumers.
This winter, they have been empty of the imported gas that filled them for years.
But now, Dominion and Maryland are bracing for the Chesapeake Bay dock, which was
once a starting point for imported gas’ journey on American soil, to be the takeoff
spot for exports.
When that happens, Cove Point will become the first operational gas exporting
facility on the East Coast. Dominion plans to begin construction by the end of the
year.
The plan to export gas has raised questions across the state about whether the
plant will be a boon for the economy or cause significant damage to the
environment.
Some Marylanders see the export plant, like Dominion does, as a job-creating
opportunity for the state that is more environmentally-friendly than coal
production.
“It gives us a chance to export something,” said Delegate James Proctor, D-Calvert
and Prince George’s.
But others see the conversion as an environmental hazard that exposes all of
Maryland to the potential risks of gas obtained through hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, and fear it could lead to use of the controversial gas-extraction method
within the state.
For Dominion executives, the switch is logical due to increased global demand for
American gas and, with $3.8 billion worth of changes, will be an efficient way to
use the existing facility.
“It’s the same thing,” said Mike Frederick, vice president of Dominion’s LNG
operations. “It’s just in reverse.”
On the Dominion property, the main change will be the addition of a liquefaction
plant that will cool the American-drilled natural gas and turn it into a liquid at
260 degrees below zero. The process reduces the gas volume and makes transporting
it more efficient.
Dominion executives said a main heat exchange system, a turbine, compressors and
cryogenic equipment will be among the project’s highest costs but declined to give
